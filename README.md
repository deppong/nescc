# NESCC
This project is intended to be a learning experience for me. I have made
several attempts to do so in the past so hopefully after further research
and all of the compounded experience this will be a bit easier. 

## Building.
At the moment this uses a very simple CMake file.
```bash
cmake -B build -S src
cmake --build build && ./build/nescc
```
